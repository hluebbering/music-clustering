    "- `release_date`: The date the album was first released.\n",
    "- `length`: The track length in milliseconds.\n",

    "- `energy`: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 that represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.\n",
    "- `instrumentalness`: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer the value is to 1.0, the more likely the track contains no vocal content.\n",
    "- `liveness`: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n",
    "- `loudness`: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Values are averaged across entire track, ranging between -60 and 0 db.\n",
    "- `speechiness`: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more speech-like the recording, the closer to 1.0.\n",
    "- `tempo`: The overall estimated speed or pace of a track in beats per minute (BPM).\n",
    "- `valence`: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. High valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric).\n",
    "- `key`: The key the track is in. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\n",
    "- `mode`: The modality (major or minor) of a track. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n",
